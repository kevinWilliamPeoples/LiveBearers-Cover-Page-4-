            <h2>What are 'Livebearers'?</h2>

            <p class="p3 paragraph">
                Livebearers are the fish that give birth to live, free-swimming young(fry) instead of laying eggs.<br>Livebearers generally reach a maximum size around 2 to 3 inches, though the exact details vary from one species to another, and they are generally peaceful in terms of their temperament. They are an excellent community fish and  can tolerate a range of temperatures between 64°F and 82°F as well as a pH between 5.5 and 8.0.
